Adolescent Births,"This dataset contains California’s adolescent birth rate (ABR) by county, age group and race/ethnicity using aggregated years 2014-2016. The ABR is calculated as the number of live births to females aged 15-19 divided by the female population aged 15-19, multiplied by 1,000. Births to females under age 15 are uncommon and thus added to the numerator (total number of births aged 15-19) in calculating the ABR for aged 15-19. The categories by age group are aged 18-19 and aged 15-17; births occurring to females under aged 15 are added to the numerator for aged 15-17 in calculating the ABR for this age group. The race and ethnic groups in this table utilized five mutually exclusive race and ethnicity categories. These categories are Hispanic and the following Non-Hispanic categories of Multi-Race, Black, American Indian (includes Eskimo and Aleut), Asian and Pacific Islander (includes Hawaiian) combined, and White.

"California Adults Who Met Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, 2013","This dataset is from the 2013 California Dietary Practices Survey of Adults. This survey has been discontinued. Adults were asked a series of eight questions about their physical activity practices in the last month. These questions were borrowed from the Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System. Data displayed in this table represent California adults who met the aerobic recommendation for physical activity, as defined by the 2008 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans and Objectives 2.1 and 2.2 of Healthy People 2020.

The California Dietary Practices Surveys (CDPS) (now discontinued) was the most extensive dietary and physical activity assessment of adults 18 years and older in the state of California. CDPS was designed in 1989 and was administered biennially in odd years up through 2013.  The CDPS was designed to monitor dietary trends, especially fruit and vegetable consumption, among California adults for evaluating their progress toward meeting the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the Healthy People 2020 Objectives. For the data in this table, adults were asked a series of eight questions about their physical activity practices in the last month. Questions included: 1) During the past month, other than your regular job, did you participate in any physical activities or exercise such as running, calisthenics, golf, gardening or walking for exercise?  2) What type of physical activity or exercise did you spend the most time doing during the past month?  3) How many times per week or per month did you take part   n this activity during the past month?  4) And when you took part in this activity, for how many minutes or hours did you usually keep at it?  5) During the past month, how many times per week or per month did you do physical activities or exercises to strengthen your muscles? Questions 2, 3, and 4 were repeated to collect a second activity. Data were collected using a list of participating CalFresh households and random digit dial, approximately 1,400-1,500 adults (ages 18 and over) were interviewed via phone survey between the months of June and October. Demographic data included gender, age, ethnicity, education level, income, physical activity level, overweight status, and food stamp eligibility status.

The corresponding calendar months are based upon reference to the first day on which the food vouchers were valid to be used (the obligation month). Some of the monthly variation in the data can be attributed to the number of days and holidays in a month. Participant redeemed data in this dataset will not match published monthly participant reports as some certified participants are enrolled but do not receive or redeem food vouchers (i.e. fully breastfeeding infant)

The Women, Infants and Children (WIC) Program is a federally-funded health and nutrition program that provides assistance to pregnant women, new mothers, infants and children under age five. WIC helps California families by providing food vouchers to individual participants based on their nutritional need and risk assessment. The food vouchers can be used to purchase healthy supplemental foods from over 4,000 WIC authorized vendor stores throughout the State. WIC also provides nutritional education, breastfeeding support, healthcare referrals and other community services. Participants must meet income guidelines and other criteria. Currently, 83 WIC agencies provide services monthly to approximately one million participants at over 650 sites in local communities throughout the State.

CA Wellness Plan Data Reference Guide,"The purpose of the California Wellness Plan (CWP) Data Reference Guide (Reference Guide) is to provide access to the lowest-level data for each CWP Objective; lowest-level data source, instructions to access data, and additional details are described. Some CWP Objectives do not have program leads, data sources, baselines, and/or targets, but are included because they were a result of CDPH program or partner input and were felt to be important to the reduction of chronic disease incidence, prevalence, and health disparities. Agencies, programs and/or partners identified with an objective may be either data stewards and/or engaged in activities to achieve the target, but may not have adequate resources for statewide activities.  Developmental Objectives will be updated as information becomes available. 

Background: The California Wellness Plan, California's Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion Plan was released February 2014 by the California Department of Public Health (CDPH).  The overarching goal of CWP is Equity in Health and Wellbeing; additional CWP Goals include: 1) Healthy Communities, 2) Optimal Health Systems Linked with Community Prevention, 3) Accessible and Usable Health Information, and 4) Prevention  Sustainability and Capacity. All CWP objectives fall under the framework of Let's Get Healthy California Task Force priorities.

Chemicals in Cosmetics,"These data reflect information that has been reported to the California Safe Cosmetics Program (CSCP) in the California Department of Public Health (CDPH). The primary purpose of the CSCP is to collect information on hazardous and potentially hazardous ingredients in cosmetic products sold in California and to make this information available to the public.   

For all cosmetic products sold in California, the California Safe Cosmetics Act (“the Act”) requires the manufacturer, packer, and/or distributor named on the product label to provide to the CSCP a list of all cosmetic products that contain any ingredients known or suspected to cause cancer, birth defects, or other developmental or reproductive harm.     

To assist companies with reporting, CDPH has compiled a list of reportable ingredients based on lists and reports available from the authoritative scientific bodies cited in the Act to cause cancer or reproductive harm; it is meant to serve as guidance and is not all-inclusive. Companies with reportable ingredients in their products must submit information to the California Safe Cosmetics Program if the company:   

*	Has annual aggregate sales of cosmetic products of one million dollars or more, and 
*	Has sold cosmetic products in California on or after January 1, 2007.   

The data table consists of: label names of cosmetic/personal care products, company/manufacturer names, product brand names, product categories, Chemical Abstracts Service registry numbers (CAS#) of the reported chemical ingredients, names of reported chemical ingredients, the number of reported chemicals for each product, and dates of reporting, product discontinuation or reformulation if applicable.   

All products containing carcinogens or developmental or reproductive toxicants may not be included due to companies failing to report.

Clostridium difficile infections (CDI) in Healthcare,"This dataset shows the Center for Disease Control and Prevention National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) of hospital onset (HO) Clostridium difficile infections (CDI) reported by California general acute care, long-term acute care and rehabilitation acute care hospitals. CDI cases are classified as HO when the positive stool sample is obtained on day four or later during the hospital stay. Risk factors found to be significant in predicting HO CDI incidence include the type of CDI test used by the hospital, if the hospital is affiliated with a medical school, hospital bed size, and the burden of community-onset CDI in patients admitted to the hospital.

Facility Types: 1) Acute Care Hospitals: Critical access acute care hospital (CAH; defined as certain facilities that participate in Medicare and that are designated by states through a protocol) 
2) Rehabilitation (REHABs) acute hospitals are hospitals with inpatient wards for evaluation and restoration of function to patients who have lost function due to acute or chronic pain, musculoskeletal problems, stroke, or catastrophic events resulting in complete or partial paralysis. These hospitals were self-identified through National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN). 
3) Long-term acute care hospitals (LTACs) are defined by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services as providing care to patients with medically complex conditions requiring an average length of stay greater than 25 days.

General Acute Care Hospitals Methods: The HO CDI standardized infection ratios SIR, which adjusts for significant risk factors, is calculated by comparing the number of CDI that occurred (or were observed) in the hospital to the number that would be predicted based on the national referent CDI rate data. Adjusting for these factors provides for a more accurate comparison of hospitals’ infections. Hospitals with NHSN-predicted number of HO CDI cases <1 had no SIRs calculated by NHSN. A SIR was calculated by CDPH if the predicted number of infections was =0.2. The SIR and its comparison are not as accurate as SIRs based on a larger number of predicted infections. For each hospital with a CDI SIR, we performed a statistical analysis to determine if the observed number of infections was significantly different than the predicted number. Based on our statistical analysis we labeled each hospital’s CDI SIR as indicating: 

•	No Difference - no difference in number of observed and predicted infections, 

•	Higher - higher or more infections than predicted, or 

•	Lower - lower or fewer infections than predicted.

The SIRs cannot be compared across hospitals because of ""indirect"" standardization methodology used in calculating the SIRs.

REHABs and LTACs Methods: The REHAB and LTAC hospital onset (HO) CDI rate is calculated by dividing the number of HO CDI cases by the total inpatient days; the rate is then reported per 10,000 patient days. The rates are not risk adjusted and may reflect factors in the hospital that can affect the occurrence of CDI, such as transmission of the C. difficile bacteria and use of antimicrobials. Differences in rates for hospitals can result from differences in laboratory testing methodology, patient populations, infection and transmission prevention practices, antibiotic utilization, and/or community onset rates of CDI. HO CDI rate in LTAC hospitals is provided separately from the rates in REHABs. Patients in LTAC hospitals have longer lengths of stay, an established risk factor for CDI. Also, specifically for LTAC and REHABs, we include whether a hospital uses the polymerase chain reaction test (PCR) to detect CDI. In this table, hospital rates of CDI for LTAC hospitals have not been adjusted to account for the differences in sensitivity between PCR and other laboratory testing methods; therefore, rates from hospitals using different types of laboratory tests are not comparable.

To link the CDPH facility IDs with those from other Departments, like OSHPD, please reference the ""Licensed Facility Cross-Walk"" Open Data table at https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/licensed-facility-crosswalk.

Health and Safety Code section 1288.55(a)(1) requires general acute care hospitals to report to the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) all cases of CDI identified in their facilities. The data are submitted by California hospitals to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN).

This dataset is a selected subset of the entire report, available on the California Department of Social Services, Research and Data Reports (RADR) website at http://www.cdss.ca.gov/research/.  CalWORKs is a welfare program that gives cash aid and services to eligible needy California families.  The program serves all 58 counties in the state and is operated locally by county welfare departments.

Death Profiles by ZIP Code,"This dataset is for death of California residents, by Zip Code. The death counts represent the deaths to California residents, regardless of the place of death occurrence. A non-California resident who dies inside of California would not be included in the dataset. 

Death Profiles by ZIP Code are tabulations of the number of deaths to California residents by ZIP Code of decedent’s residence. Data are aggregated by decedent's sex, age, and cause of death and is obtained from registered death certificates for California residents who died in California and from registered in other states for California residents who died out of state. Deaths by these key indicators provide significantly more detail than countywide data in monitoring a community’s health status. Moreover, death data at the ZIP Code level, can be used to perform small area analysis to identify and target areas within cities and counties where public health programs may be needed. Age Categories: Decedent's age was stratified into the same categories commonly used by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). The categories are: under one year of age; 1 to 4; 5 to 14; 15 to 24; 25 to 34; 35 to 44; 45 to 54; 55 to 64; 65 to 74; 75 to 84; 85 and over. http://www.cdph.ca.gov/data/statistics/Pages/DeathProfilesbyZIPCode.aspx

Educational Attainment,"This table contains data on the percent of population age 25 and up with a four-year college degree or higher for California, its regions, counties, county subdivisions, cities, towns, and census tracts. Greater educational attainment has been associated with health-promoting behaviors including consumption of fruits and vegetables and other aspects of healthy eating, engaging in regular physical activity, and refraining from excessive consumption of alcohol and from smoking. Completion of formal education (e.g., high school) is a key pathway to employment and access to healthier and higher paying jobs that can provide food, housing, transportation, health insurance, and other basic necessities for a healthy life. Education is linked with social and psychological factors, including sense of control, social standing and social support. These factors can improve health through reducing stress, influencing health-related behaviors and providing practical and emotional support.  More information on the data table and a data dictionary can be found in the Data and Resources section.  The educational attainment table is part of a series of indicators in the Healthy Communities Data and Indicators Project (HCI) of the Office of Health Equity. The goal of HCI is to enhance public health by providing data, a standardized set of statistical measures, and tools that a broad array of sectors can use for planning healthy communities and evaluating the impact of plans, projects, policy, and environmental changes on community health. The creation of healthy social, economic, and physical environments that promote healthy behaviors and healthy outcomes requires coordination and collaboration across multiple sectors, including transportation, housing, education, agriculture and others. Statistical metrics, or indicators, are needed to help local, regional, and state public health and partner agencies assess community environments and plan for healthy communities that optimize public health. More information on HCI can be found here: https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OHE/CDPH%20Document%20Library/Accessible%202%20CDPH_Healthy_Community_Indicators1pager5-16-12.pdf  

The format of the educational attainment table is based on the standardized data format for all HCI indicators. As a result, this data table contains certain variables used in the HCI project (e.g., indicator ID, and indicator definition). Some of these variables may contain the same value for all observations.

Food Affordability,"This table contains data on the average cost of a market basket of nutritious food items relative to income for female-headed households with children, for California, its regions, counties, and cities/towns.  The ratio uses data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Census Bureau. The table is part of a series of indicators in the Healthy Communities Data and Indicators Project of the Office of Health Equity. 
An adequate, nutritious diet is a necessity at all stages of life. Inadequate diets can impair intellectual performance and have been linked to more frequent school absence and poorer educational achievement in children. Nutrition also plays a significant role in causing or preventing a number of illnesses, such as cardiovascular disease, some cancers, obesity, type 2 diabetes, and anemia.
At least two factors influence the affordability of food and the dietary choices of families – the cost of food and family income. The inability to afford food is a major factor in food insecurity, which has a spectrum of effects including anxiety over food sufficiency or food shortages; reduced quality or desirability of diet; and disrupted eating patterns and reduced food intake.

High School Electronic Smoking Device and Tobacco Use Prevalence,"This dataset contains two data files 1) High school electronic smoking device use and 2) High school tobacco use. Tobacco use is defined as having used either cigarettes, little cigars or cigarillos, cigars, kreteks (clove cigars), hookah, electronic smoking devices (e.g. e-cigarettes, vape pens, pod mods), or smokeless tobacco (e.g. chew, dip, snuff, snus). See the individual file description for more information on each data file.
 
The California Student Tobacco Survey (CSTS) is an on-going in-school survey of tobacco use among California middle and high school students. The purpose of the survey is to assess the use of, knowledge of, and attitudes toward cigarettes and emerging tobacco products (e.g. e-cigarettes, hookah, cigarillos). The California Tobacco Control Program coordinates statewide tobacco control efforts and funds the California Student Tobacco Survey (CSTS).

Percent of Household Overcrowding (> 1.0 persons per room) and Severe Overcrowding (> 1.5 persons per room),"This dataset contains two tables on the percent of household overcrowding (> 1.0 persons per room) and severe overcrowding (> 1.5 persons per room) for California, its regions, counties, and cities/towns.  Data is from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy (CHAS) and U.S. Census American Community Survey (ACS). The table is part of a series of indicators in the Healthy Communities Data and Indicators Project (HCI) of the Office of Health Equity: Healthy Communities Data and Indicators Project of the Office of Health Equity. Residential crowding has been linked to an increased risk of infection from communicable diseases, a higher prevalence of respiratory ailments, and greater vulnerability to homelessness among the poor.  Residential crowding reflects demographic and socioeconomic conditions.  Older-adult immigrant and recent immigrant communities, families with low income and renter-occupied households are more likely to experience household crowding.  A form of residential overcrowding known as ""doubling up""—co-residence with family members or friends for economic reasons—is the most commonly reported prior living situation for families and individuals before the onset of homelessness.  More information about the data table and a data dictionary can be found in the About/Attachments section.The household crowding table is part of a series of indicators in the Healthy Communities Data and Indicators Project (HCI) of the Office of Health Equity. The goal of HCI is to enhance public health by providing data, a standardized set of statistical measures, and tools that a broad array of sectors can use for planning healthy communities and evaluating the impact of plans, projects, policy, and environmental changes on community health. The creation of healthy social, economic, and physical environments that promote healthy behaviors and healthy outcomes requires coordination and collaboration across multiple sectors, including transportation, housing, education, agriculture and others. Statistical metrics, or indicators, are needed to help local, regional, and state public health and partner agencies assess community environments and plan for healthy communities that optimize public health. More information on HCI can be found here: https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OHE/CDPH%20Document%20Library/Accessible%202%20CDPH_Healthy_Community_Indicators1pager5-16-12.pdf  
The format of the household overcrowding tables is based on the standardized data format for all HCI indicators. As a result, this data table contains certain variables used in the HCI project (e.g., indicator ID, and indicator definition). Some of these variables may contain the same value for all observations.

Immunizations in Child Care by Academic Year,"This dataset contains immunization status of child care facility enrollees aged 2 years to 4 years 11 months in California in facilities with 10 or more children enrolled. Smaller schools were excluded to help protect privacy. Explanation of the different immunizations is in the attached data dictionary. The California Health and Safety Code Section 120325-75 requires students to provide proof of immunization for school and child care entry. Additionally, California Health and Safety Code Section 120375 and California Code of Regulation Section 6075 require all schools and child care facilities to assess and report annually the immunization status of their enrollees.

The annual child care assessment is conducted each fall to monitor compliance with the California School Immunization law. Results from this assessment are used to measure immunization coverage among children entering licensed child care facilities. This data set presents results from the child care assessment and immunization coverage in licensed child care facilities by county. Not all facilities reported.

Income Inequality,"This table contains data on income inequality.  The primary measure is the Gini index – a measure of the extent to which the distribution of income among families/households within a community deviates from a perfectly equal distribution.  The index ranges from 0.0, when all families (households) have equal shares of income (implies perfect equality), to 1.0 when one family (household) has all the income and the rest have none (implies perfect inequality).  Index data is provided for California and its counties, regions, and large cities/towns. The data is from the U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey. The table is part of a series of indicators in the Healthy Communities Data and Indicators Project of the Office of Health Equity. Income is linked to acquiring resources for healthy living. Both household income and the distribution of income across a society independently contribute to the overall health status of a community. On average Western industrialized nations with large disparities in income distribution tend to have poorer health status than similarly advanced nations with a more equitable distribution of income. Approximately 119,200 (5%) of the 2.4 million U.S. deaths in 2000 are attributable to income inequality. The pathways by which income inequality act to increase adverse health outcomes are not known with certainty, but policies that provide for a strong safety net of health and social services have been identified as potential buffers.

"Infant Mortality, Deaths Per 1,000 Live Births (LGHC Indicator)","This is a source dataset for a Let's Get Healthy California indicator at https://letsgethealthy.ca.gov/.
Infant Mortality is defined as the number of deaths in infants under one year of age per 1,000 live births. Infant mortality is often used as an indicator to measure the health and well-being of a community, because factors affecting the health of entire populations can also impact the mortality rate of infants. Although California’s infant mortality rate is better than the national average, there are significant disparities, with African American babies dying at more than twice the rate of other groups.
Data are from the Birth Cohort Files. The infant mortality indicator computed from the birth cohort file comprises birth certificate information on all births that occur in a calendar year (denominator) plus death certificate information linked to the birth certificate for those infants who were born in that year but subsequently died within 12 months of birth (numerator). Studies of infant mortality that are based on information from death certificates alone have been found to underestimate infant death rates for infants of all race/ethnic groups and especially for certain race/ethnic groups, due to problems such as confusion about event registration requirements, incomplete data, and transfers of newborns from one facility to another for medical care. 
Note there is a separate data table ""Infant Mortality by Race/Ethnicity"" which is based on death records only, which is more timely but less accurate than the Birth Cohort File.
Single year shown to provide state-level data and county totals for the most recent year. Numerator: Infants deaths (under age 1 year). Denominator: Live births occurring to California state residents. Multiple years aggregated to allow for stratification at the county level.
For this indicator, race/ethnicity is based on the birth certificate information, which records the race/ethnicity of the mother. The mother can “decline to state”; this is considered to be a valid response. These responses are not displayed on the indicator visualization.",California Department of Public Health,"California Department of Public Health, Center for Health Statistics and Informatics",opendata@cdph.ca.gov,None,2009-2016,State,other,English (EN),annually,Suppressed if less than 10 events,,"The Birth Cohort Files contain data for all live births that occurred in a calendar year, death information for those infants who were born in that year but subsequently died within 12 months of birth, and all fetal deaths that also occurred during that calendar year.",Terms of Use,Limitations,,"Analysis by strata excludes records where that strata is unknown.

Insurance Affordability Programs Eligibility Appeals Hearing Results,"This dataset includes the hearing results for eligibility appeals filed for subsidized Covered California coverage, Medi-Cal, or a combination of both eligibility determinations by year and quarter. 
The Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) assigns responsibility for conducting fair hearing requests (appeals) to the California Department of Social Services (CDSS). CDSS receives appeal requests, conducts hearings through their statewide network of administrative law judges, and renders decisions. CDSS provides these services to DHCS through a contract called an interagency agreement. In addition to the interagency agreement, the Delegation Order gives an Administrative Law Judge the authority to review and adopt decisions for hearings. 
Hearing requests (appeals) may be filed for cases involving mixed determinations, such as when household members applied for and/or had eligibility determinations made for the two programs (i.e., parents were eligible for Covered California and the child(ren) were eligible for Medi-Cal). Hearings are held when an appeal filed by an appellant for determinations that resulted in a denial, eligibility, or discontinuance of coverage. This dataset provides categories of hearing results and includes granted, granted in part, denied, or withdrawn/dismissed.

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream Infections (MRSA BSI)  in Healthcare,"This dataset shows the incidence rates of hospital onset (HO) methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections (MRSA BSI) reported by California free-standing acute care hospitals, rehabilitation acute care hospitals and rehabilitation units, and long-term acute care hospitals with their own Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services certification number (CCN).   MRSA BSI cases are classified as HO when a positive blood sample is obtained on day four or later during a hospital stay, from a patient with no prior positive blood culture within the preceding two weeks.

Facility Types: 
1) Acute Care Hospitals: Critical access acute care hospital (CAH; defined as certain facilities that participate in Medicare and that are designated by states through a protocol) 
2) Rehabilitation (REHABs) acute hospitals are hospitals with inpatient wards for evaluation and restoration of function to patients who have lost function due to acute or chronic pain, musculoskeletal problems, stroke, or catastrophic events resulting in complete or partial paralysis. These hospitals were self-identified through National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN). 
3) Long-term acute care hospitals (LTACs) are defined by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services as providing care to patients with medically complex conditions requiring an average length of stay greater than 25 days.

Acute Care Hospitals Methods: The HO MRSA BSI SIR, which adjusts for significant risk factors, is calculated by comparing the number of MRSA BSI that occurred (or were observed) in the hospital to the number that would be predicted based on the national referent MRSA BSI rate data. Risk factors found to be significant in predicting HO MRSA BSI incidence include hospital bed size, affiliation with a medical school, and the community burden of MRSA BSI as observed in patients admitted to the hospital. Adjusting for these factors provides for a more accurate comparison of hospitals’ infections. For more precise comparisons, NHSN only calculates a SIR when at least one HO MRSA BSI is predicted, which is determined by patient volume and other factors predictive of acquiring MRSA BSI. However, we calculated the SIR for such hospitals with HO MRSA BSI predicted less than one if the number of HO MRSA BSI predicted was ≥ 0.2. For each hospital with a MRSA BSI SIR, we performed a statistical analysis to determine if the observed number of infections was significantly different than the predicted number. Based on our statistical analysis we labeled each hospital’s MRSA BSI SIR as indicating: 
•	No Different - no difference in number of observed and predicted infections, 
•	Higher - high or more infections than predicted, or 
•	Lower - low or fewer infections than predicted

REHABs and LTACs Methods: The HO MRSA BSI rate is calculated by dividing the number of cases by the total number of patient days; the rate is then reported per 10,000 patient days. The MRSA BSI rates in this data release are not risk adjusted because there are no such methods available at this time for REHABs and LTACs. In addition to patient-based risk factors, the unadjusted REHAB and LTACs MRSA BSI rates herein are also affected by facility bed size, community prevalence rate, clinical and infection control practices, and/or surveillance methods. While stratifying MRSA BSI rates by hospital type may make rates more comparable, it cannot control for all factors that can affect MRSA BSI rates. Therefore, comparisons between hospitals within REHABs should still be made with caution. That is, differences in rates within this hospital type can represent other factors besides differences in infection and transmission prevention practices. 

To link the CDPH facility IDs with those from other Departments, like OSHPD, please reference the ""Licensed Facility Cross-Walk"" Open Data table at https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/licensed-facility-crosswalk.

Health and Safety Code section 1288.55(a)(1) requires general acute care hospitals to report to the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) all cases of MRSA BSI identified in their facilities. The data are submitted by California hospitals to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN).

Modified Retail Food Environment Index,"This table contains data on the modified retail food environment index for California, its regions, counties, cities, towns, and census tracts.   An adequate, nutritious diet is a necessity at all stages of life. Pregnant women and their developing babies, children, adolescents, adults, and older adults depend on adequate nutrition for optimum development and maintenance of health and functioning. Nutrition also plays a significant role in causing or preventing a number of illnesses, such as cardiovascular disease, some cancers, obesity, type-2 diabetes, and anemia. Peoples’ food choices and their likelihood of being overweight or obese are also influenced by their food environment: the foods available in their neighborhoods including stores, restaurants, schools, and worksites.  

The modified retail food environment index table is part of a series of indicators in the Healthy Communities Data and Indicators Project (HCI) of the Office of Health Equity. The goal of HCI is to enhance public health by providing data, a standardized set of statistical measures, and tools that a broad array of sectors can use for planning healthy communities and evaluating the impact of plans, projects, policy, and environmental changes on community health. The creation of healthy social, economic, and physical environments that promote healthy behaviors and healthy outcomes requires coordination and collaboration across multiple sectors, including transportation, housing, education, agriculture and others. Statistical metrics, or indicators, are needed to help local, regional, and state public health and partner agencies assess community environments and plan for healthy communities that optimize public health. More information on HCI can be found here: https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OHE/CDPH%20Document%20Library/Accessible%202%20CDPH_Healthy_Community_Indicators1pager5-16-12.pdf  

The format of the modified retail food environment table is based on the standardized data format for all HCI indicators. As a result, this data table contains certain variables used in the HCI project (e.g., indicator ID, and indicator definition). Some of these variables may contain the same value for all observations.

"Obesity in California, 2012 and 2013","These data are from the 2013 California Dietary Practices Surveys (CDPS), 2012 California Teen Eating, Exercise and Nutrition Survey (CalTEENS), and 2013 California Children’s Healthy Eating and Exercise Practices Surveys (CalCHEEPS). These surveys have been discontinued.  Adults, adolescents, and children (with parental assistance) were asked for their current height and weight, from which, body mass index (BMI) was calculated. For adults, a BMI of 30.0 and above is considered obese. For adolescents and children, obesity is defined as having a BMI at or above the 95th percentile, according to CDC growth charts.

The California Dietary Practices Surveys (CDPS), the California Teen Eating, Exercise and Nutrition Survey (CalTEENS), and the California Children’s Healthy Eating and Exercise Practices Surveys (CalCHEEPS) (now discontinued) were the most extensive dietary and physical activity assessments of adults 18 years and older, adolescents 12 to 17, and children 6 to 11, respectively, in the state of California. CDPS and CalCHEEPS were administered biennially in odd years up through 2013 and CalTEENS was administered biennially in even years through 2014.  The surveys were designed to monitor dietary trends, especially fruit and vegetable consumption, among Californias for evaluating their progress toward meeting the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the Healthy People 2020 Objectives. All three surveys were conducted via telephone. Adult and adolescent data were collected using a list of participating CalFresh households and random digit dial, and child data were collected using only the list of CalFresh households. Older children (9-11) were the primary respondents with some parental assistance. For younger children (6-8), the primary respondent was parents. Data were oversampled for low-income and African American to provide greater sensitivity for analyzing trends among the target population. Wording of the question used for these analyses varied by survey (age group). The questions were worded are as follows:  Adult:1) How tall are you without shoes?2) How much do you weigh?Adolescent:1) About how much do you weigh without shoes?2) About how tall are you without shoes?

"Park, Beach, Open Space, or Coastline Access","This table contains data on access to parks measured as the percent of population within ½ a mile of a parks, beach, open space or coastline for California, its regions, counties, county subdivisions, cities, towns, and census tracts. More information on the data table and a data dictionary can be found in the Data and Resources section.  As communities become increasingly more urban, parks and the protection of green and open spaces within cities increase in importance. Parks and natural areas buffer pollutants and contribute to the quality of life by providing communities with social and psychological benefits such as leisure, play, sports, and contact with nature. Parks are critical to human health by providing spaces for health and wellness activities. The access to parks table is part of a series of indicators in the Healthy Communities Data and Indicators Project (HCI) of the Office of Health Equity. The goal of HCI is to enhance public health by providing data, a standardized set of statistical measures, and tools that a broad array of sectors can use for planning healthy communities and evaluating the impact of plans, projects, policy, and environmental changes on community health. The creation of healthy social, economic, and physical environments that promote healthy behaviors and healthy outcomes requires coordination and collaboration across multiple sectors, including transportation, housing, education, agriculture and others. Statistical metrics, or indicators, are needed to help local, regional, and state public health and partner agencies assess community environments and plan for healthy communities that optimize public health. 
The format of the access to parks table is based on the standardized data format for all HCI indicators. As a result, this data table contains certain variables used in the HCI project (e.g., indicator ID, and indicator definition). Some of these variables may contain the same value for all observations.

Parks greater than 1 acre with ‘Open Access’ designation were selected for analysis. Half mile buffers were created around parks. Census blocks with centroids inside the parks buffer area were selected. 2010 block-level Census redistricting data (100% count by race/ethnicity) were merged with blocks inside the parks buffer area. This process was conducted for all parks and by park type. Block data were aggregated by census tract, city/town, county, region, and state. The percent of residents’ access to parks were calculated for each geographic level and for race/ethnicity strata. Regions were based on counties of metropolitan transportation organizations (MPO) regions as reported in the 2010 California Regional Progress Report (http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/tpp/offices/orip/ Collaborative%20Planning/Files/ CARegionalProgress_2-1-2011.pdf).

Proportion of Adults Who Are Current Smokers (LGHC Indicator),"This is a source dataset for a Let's Get Healthy California indicator at https://letsgethealthy.ca.gov/. Adult smoking prevalence in California, males and females aged 18+, starting in 2012. Caution must be used when comparing the percentages of smokers over time as the definition of ‘current smoker’ was broadened in 1996, and the survey methods were changed in 2012. Current cigarette smoking is defined as having smoked at least 100 cigarettes in lifetime and now smoking every day or some days. Due to the methodology change in 2012, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend not conducting analyses where estimates from 1984 – 2011 are compared with analyses using the new methodology, beginning in 2012. This includes analyses examining trends and changes over time. (For more information, please see the narrative description.)
The California Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is an on-going telephone survey of randomly selected adults, which collects information on a wide variety of health-related behaviors and preventive health practices related to the leading causes of death and disability such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes and injuries. Data are collected monthly from a random sample of the California population aged 18 years and older. The BRFSS is conducted by Public Health Survey Research Program of California State University, Sacramento under contract from CDPH. The survey has been conducted since 1984 by the California Department of Public Health in collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In 2012, the survey methodology of the California BRFSS changed significantly so that the survey would be more representative of the general population. Several changes were implemented: 1) the survey became dual-frame, with both cell and landline random-digit dial components, 2) residents of college housing were eligible to complete the BRFSS, and 3) raking or iterative proportional fitting was used to calculate the survey weights. Due to these changes, estimates from 1984 – 2011 are not comparable to estimates from 2012 and beyond. Center for Disease Control and Policy (CDC) and recommend not conducting analyses where estimates from 1984 – 2011 are compared with analyses using the new methodology, beginning in 2012.

Proportion of High School Students Who Smoked Cigarettes in the Past 30 Days (LGHC Indicator),"This is a source dataset for a Let's Get Healthy California indicator at https://letsgethealthy.ca.gov/. The California Tobacco Control Program coordinates statewide tobacco control efforts and funds the California Student Tobacco Survey (CSTS). The data table shows the current smoking prevalence from 2001-2002 to 2015-2016 for California high school youth by selected demographics. Current cigarette smoking was defined as having smoked on one or more days during the past 30 days prior to the survey. 
In statistics, a confidence interval is a measure of the reliability of an estimate. It is a type of interval estimate of a population parameter. The CSTS is a large-scale biennial survey, in-school student survey administered to middle (grades 8) and high school (grades 10 and 12) students.

"Providers Delivering Family Planning, Access, Care, and Treatment (PACT) Services, by Fiscal Years","This dataset contains information on the number of providers delivering services through the Family Planning, Access, Care, and Treatment (Family PACT) Program (https://www.dhcs.ca.gov/services/ofp/Pages/OfficeofFamilyPlanning.aspx) from July 1, 2003 through June 30, 2016. Delivering Family PACT services was defined as having been reimbursed for at least one claim for any services through Family PACT. Providers for whom all Family PACT claims have been denied were not designated as delivering providers. All Family PACT providers must also be enrolled as Medi-Cal providers, and Medi-Cal clinician providers who are not enrolled in Family PACT may provide Family PACT services by referral from an enrolled Family PACT provider. This dataset includes the following variables: enrolled Family PACT clinician providers, Medi-Cal clinician providers (not enrolled in Family PACT), total clinician providers, pharmacies, labs, and the percent change in all of these variables from the previous fiscal year. Providers are counted according to their provider type. For example, if a laboratory or pharmacy is associated with a clinician provider both the laboratory or pharmacy and the clinician are counted. In the eighteen full fiscal year (FY) of operation, FY 2015-16, 6,886 providers were reimbursed for services delivered under the Family PACT Program. Of these, 2,378 were clinician providers, 4,382 were pharmacy providers, and 126 were laboratories. Of the 2,378 clinician providers, 2,049 were also enrolled in Family PACT.

Respondents Indicating At Least 1 Type of Adverse Childhood Experience (LGHC Indicator),"This is a source dataset for a Let's Get Healthy California indicator at https://letsgethealthy.ca.gov/. The Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) module of the Behavioral Risk Factors Surveillance System (BRFSS) asks respondents questions about eight different traumatic childhood experiences that occurred before the age of 18. These include verbal/emotional abuse, physical abuse, sexual abuse, and negative household situations including the incarceration of an adult, alcohol or drug abuse by an adult, violence between adults, mental illness of a household member, and parental divorce or separation. A cumulative ACEs score is calculated for each respondent by counting the number of these items that a respondent reported experiencing, creating a score ranging from 0 to 8.
11 questions about adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are condensed into a ordinal scale from 0 to 8 possible ACEs. This indicator shows the prevalence of adults who reported having 1 or more ACEs. However other data cuts are available, e.g., 3 or more ACEs The ACEs module is a very ""lagging"" indicator capturing childhood experiences retrospectively by asking adults 18+ years of age.

Retail Availability of Electronic Smoking Devices by County,"This data table shows the percentage of tobacco retailer stores that sell electronic smoking devices (including e-cigarettes, other vapor devices or e-liquids) in 2013 and 2016 by county. Data for three city health departments (Berkeley, Long Beach and Pasadena) were analyzed separately, results for Alameda County include the city of Berkeley and results for Los Angeles County include the cities of Pasadena and Long Beach. Results were suppressed for items with a small sample size (n =< 5) and for results considered unreliable (coefficient of variation greater than or equal to 0.5). Cities or counties that conducted a census of tobacco retailers will not have a confidence interval due to the survey methodology.

The Healthy Stores for a Healthy Community (HSHC) marketing survey measured the availability of a range of unhealthy and healthy products, as well as marketing practices for tobacco, alcohol, food and beverage items, and condoms. The California Tobacco Control Program (CTCP) invited partners in the Nutrition Education and Obesity Prevention Branch at the California Department of Public Health (CDPH), the Substance Use Disorders Program at the California Department of Health Care Services (DHCS), and the Sexually Transmitted Diseases Control Branch at CDPH to join the campaign and look at the retail environment from a more comprehensive perspective, as there were many local and state efforts examining one or more of these health issues in community stores. This collaboration is part of the state’s continued effort to address the burden of chronic disease and to better understand the role that stores could play in making communities healthier. In 2013, the 61 local lead agencies (LLAs) completed the HSHC survey in a total of 7,393 randomly selected stores that sell tobacco throughout the state of California. In 2016, the LLAs completed a follow-up survey in 7,152 randomly selected stores that sell tobacco statewide.

School Immunizations in 7th Grade by Academic Year,"This dataset contains immunization status of 7th grade students in California in schools with 10 or more 7th grade students enrolled. Smaller schools were excluded to help protect privacy. Students in 7th Grade were considered to have up-to-date immunizations if they had completed the Tdap immunization requirement to receive one dose of any immunization (Tdap, DTaP or DTP) that protects against pertussis on or after their 7th birthday. The California Health and Safety Code Section 120325-75 requires students to provide proof of immunization for school and child care entry. Additionally, California Health and Safety Code Section 120375 and California Code of Regulation Section 6075 require all schools and child care facilities to assess and report annually the immunization status of their enrollees.

Under Assembly Bill 354 (2010), California Health and Safety Code Section 120335 required students in 7th grade to provide documentation of either having received a booster immunization against pertussis or an exemption to immunization.

Surgical Site Infections (SSIs) for Operative Procedures in Healthcare,"This dataset shows the surgical site infections (SSIs) reported by a hospital to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN).   The data is provided in two tables 1) SSIs for the 5 Operative procedures and 2) SSIs for 24 Operative procedures. All procedure and infection data for surgical procedures performed were downloaded from NHSN for each years data release. The hospital submitted procedure counts and infection counts are displayed.

5 Operative Procedures Methods: SSIs for the 5 Operative procedures without risk adjusted comparisons (Heart transplant, Kidney surgery, Pacemaker Surgery, Spleen surgery, Ovarian surgery) 

24 Operative Procedures Methods: The 24 Operative procedures with NHSN Standardized Infections Ratios (SIR) are: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Repair, Appendix surgery,  Bile Duct, Liver or Pancreatic surgery, Cardiac surgery, Coronary artery bypass graft with both chest and donor site incisions, Coronary artery bypass graft with chest incision only, Gallbladder surgery, Colon surgery, Cesarean section, Spinal Fusion, Open reduction of fracture, Gastric surgery, Hip prosthesis, Abdominal hysterectomy, Knee prosthesis,  Kidney transplant, Laminectomy, Liver transplant, Rectal surgery, Refusion of spine, Small bowel surgery, Thoracic surgery, Vaginal hysterectomy, Exploratory laparotomy.

The SIR is calculated by dividing the number of observed infections by the number of predicted infections. The number of predicted infections is calculated using SSI probabilities estimated from multivariate logistic regression models constructed from NHSN data during a baseline time period 2006 through 2008, which represents a reference population’s SSI experience. The SIR calculated only if the number of observed is at least one, to enforce a minimum precision criterion and these SIRs are based on the date of procedure, not the date of event.

The SIR used for this table is risk adjusted SIR that considers only complex SSI identified during hospital Admission or Readmission to the same hospital following inpatient surgeries and hereafter referred to as SIR. A SIR was calculated by CDPH, if the predicted number of infections was less than 1 and greater than or equal 0.2. This SIR and its comparison are not as accurate as SIRs based on a larger number of predicted infections. For a detailed explanation, please see the Technical Notes. The hospital submitted procedure counts and infection counts are displayed along with an SIR and, the 95 percent confidence interval for the SIR and the statistical comparison as follow: 

•	No difference - no difference in number of observed and predicted infections

•	Higher - more infections than predicted, or

•	Lower - fewer infections than predicted.

Central Line-Associated Bloodstream infections (CLABSI) in Healthcare,"This dataset includes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) Standardized Infection Ratios (SIR) adjusted for patient care locations for hospitals, long-term acute care and patient care areas.

Facility Types:

• Acute Care Hospitals:  Critical access acute care hospital (CAH; defined as certain facilities that participate in Medicare and that are designated by states through a protocol)

• Long-term Acute Care Hospitals (LTACs) are defined by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services as providing care to patients with medically complex conditions requiring an average length of stay greater than 25 days. 

• Four Patient Care Areas include: 1) Critical Care Areas (CCAs) are nursing care areas that provide intensive observation, diagnosis, and therapeutic procedures for patients who are critically ill. These areas exclude step-down, intermediate, or telemetry care areas. 2) Neonatal Critical Care (NCC) Areas specialize in Level II/III and/or Level III critical care provided to newborns and infants. 3) General Care Areas (WARDS) include the following types of locations: stepdown general care locations specializing in patients that are hemodynamically stable; medical general care locations providing evaluation and treatment of nonsurgical conditions; medical/surgical general care locations providing evaluation and treatment of medical and/or surgical conditions; surgical general care locations providing evaluation and treatment for pre- or post-surgical conditions; long-term acute care locations specializing in patients requiring an extended stay in an acute care environment; adult rehabilitation general care locations providing care to patients who have lost function; labor, delivery, recovery, postpartum general care locations providing evaluation and treatment of normal and high risk pregnancy patients; behavioral general care locations providing evaluation and treatment of patients with acute psychiatric or behavioral disorders; jail general care locations providing evaluation and treatment of patients who are in custody of law enforcement during their treatment; pediatric general care locations providing evaluation or treatment to any patient less than or equal to 18 years of age for any medical or surgical condition; and pediatric rehabilitation locations providing care to patients less than or equal to 18 years of age who have lost function. 4) Special Care Areas (SCA) are nursing care areas which specialize in patients who undergo bone marrow (stem cell) transplant for the treatment of various disorders; or require management and treatment for cancer and/or blood disorders; or require postoperative care after solid organ transplant. 

Acute Care Hospital and LTAC Methods: The CLABSI data for each hospital include number of observed (reported) CLABSIs, number of predicted CLABSIs (based on the national baseline data), number of central line-days, CLABSI SIRs and their associated 95% confidence intervals, and the statistical interpretation as follows:

• No difference - no difference in number of observed and predicted infections

• Higher - more infections than predicted, or

• Lower - fewer infections than predicted. 

CLABSI SIRs are influenced by clinical and infection control practices related to central line insertion and infection control maintenance practices, patient-based risk factors, and surveillance methods. While CLABSI SIRs are only adjusted for patient care locations, they cannot control for all individual patient factors that can affect CLABSI SIRs. A low CLABSI SIR may reflect greater diligence with infection prevention or may result from less effective surveillance methods that detect fewer infections, including failure to appropriately apply standardized surveillance definitions and protocols. Similarly, a high SIR may reflect failure to consistently implement all recommended infection prevention practices or more aggressive infection surveillance including more consistent application of standardized surveillance definitions and protocols. Finally, SIRs cannot be compared across hospitals because of the limitation in the ""indirect"" standardization methodology used in calculating the SIRs. 

Patient Care Area Methods: These combined CLABSI rates table shows the hospital-specific CLABSI data and central line insertion practices (CLIP) adherence percent by patient care locations in CCAs, NCCs and one treatment area within SCA, ""Oncology - Medical/Surgical Critical Care"", Permanent and Temporary Central Line Days. The CLABSI measures include the number of CLABSIs, central line-days, patient days, CLABSI rates and their 95% confidence intervals. We also performed statistical analyses to determine if the rates are statistically higher, lower, or no different than the California average rates by patient care locations. We know CLABSI rates are influenced by clinical and infection control practices related to central line insertion and maintenance procedures, patient-based risk factors, and surveillance methods. While stratifying CLABSI rates by patient care location makes rates more comparable, this data risk adjusted procedure cannot control for all individual patient factors that can affect CLABSI rates. A low CLABSI rate may reflect greater diligence with infection prevention or may result from less effective surveillance methods that detect fewer infections, including the failure to consistently apply all currently accepted standardized surveillance definitions and protocols. Similarly, a high rate may reflect the failure to consistently implement all recommended infection prevention practices or use more aggressive infection surveillance methods that can include the application of standardized surveillance definitions and protocols.

Health Care Personnel Influenza Vaccination,"Health and Safety Code section 1288.7(a) requires California acute care hospitals to offer influenza vaccine free of charge to all healthcare providers (HCP) or sign a declination form if a HCP chooses not to be vaccinated. Hospitals must report HCP influenza vaccination data to the California Department of Public Health (CDPH), including the percentage of HCP vaccinated. CDPH is required to make this information public on an annual basis [Health and Safety Code section 1288.8 (b)].

California acute care hospitals are required to offer free influenza vaccine to HCP. Hospital HCP must receive an annual vaccine or sign a declination form. Hospitals collect vaccination data for all HCP physically working in the hospital for at least one day during influenza season, regardless of clinical responsibility or patient contact. Hospitals report HCP vaccination rates to the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) and CDPH publishes the hospital results annually. CDPH reports data separately for hospital employees, licensed independent practitioners such as physicians, other contract staff, and trainees and volunteers (Health and Safety Code section 1288.7-1288.8).

Detailed information about the variables included in each dataset are described in the accompanying data dictionaries for the year of interest.

"Number of licensed day care center slots per 1,000 children aged 0-5 years","This table contains data on the number of licensed day care center slots (facility capacity) per 1,000 children aged 0-5 years in California, its regions, counties, cities, towns, and census tracts. The table contains 2015 data, and includes type of facility (day care center or infant center). Access to child care has become a critical support for working families. Many working families find high-quality child care unaffordable, and the increasing cost of child care can be crippling for low-income families and single parents. These barriers can impact parental choices of child care. Increased availability of child care facilities can positively impact families by providing more choices of child care in terms of price and quality. Estimates for this indicator are provided for the total population, and are not available by race/ethnicity. More information on the data table and a data dictionary can be found in the Data and Resources section.
The licensed day care centers table is part of a series of indicators in the Healthy Communities Data and Indicators Project (HCI) of the Office of Health Equity. The goal of HCI is to enhance public health by providing data, a standardized set of statistical measures, and tools that a broad array of sectors can use for planning healthy communities and evaluating the impact of plans, projects, policy, and environmental changes on community health. The creation of healthy social, economic, and physical environments that promote healthy behaviors and healthy outcomes requires coordination and collaboration across multiple sectors, including transportation, housing, education, agriculture and others. Statistical metrics, or indicators, are needed to help local, regional, and state public health and partner agencies assess community environments and plan for healthy communities that optimize public health. More information on HCI can be found here: https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OHE/CDPH%20Document%20Library/Accessible%202%20CDPH_Healthy_Community_Indicators1pager5-16-12.pdf

The format of the licensed day care centers table is based on the standardized data format for all HCI indicators. As a result, this data table contains certain variables used in the HCI project (e.g., indicator ID, and indicator definition). Some of these variables may contain the same value for all observations.

Patient Violence Incidence Rates,"
Department of State Hospitals (DSH)-wide Violence Data Monthly Rates of Assault from 2010-2017 for the following groups: Patient Assault (A2), Staff Assault (A4).

A2 - Patient physical assaults are committed by another patient. Formally defined as “Aggressive Act to Another Patient - Physical: Hitting, pushing, kicking or similar acts directed against another individual to cause potential or actual injury.” This does not include verbal assault, which is coded as “A1.” 

A4 – Staff physical assaults are committed by a patient. Formally defined as “Aggressive Act to Staff - Physical: Hitting, pushing, kicking, or similar acts directed against a staff person that could cause potential or actual injury.” This does not include verbal assault, which is coded as “A3.” 

Please Note:

1.Please note that it is an update to the previously published dataset with additional datasets.


2.Violence Rates value (in previous publication) can be calculated as a number per 1000 Patient Days. This number is easily interpreted and enables more accurate comparisons across time.


3.Prior to January 1, 2016 DSH-Atascadero coded an assault as Patient on Staff (A4) only when physical contact was made between patient and staff. All other Department of State Hospitals (DSH)- facilities code an assault as Patient on Staff (A4) either when physical contact was made or when physical contact was attempted. On January 1, 2016 Department of State Hospitals (DSH)--Atascadero began coding assaults in the same manner as all other Department of State Hospitals (DSH)- facilities. 


4.Prior to January 1, 2016 Violence incidents were not captured specifically as Physical Contact made or Physical Contact Attempted.

The table is part of a series of indicators in the Healthy Communities Data and Indicators Project of the Office of Health Equity.  Active modes of transport, bicycling and walking alone and in combination with public transit, offer opportunities to incorporate physical activity into the daily routine.  Physical activity is associated with lowering rates of heart disease and stroke, diabetes, colon and breast cancer, dementia and depression.  Automobile commuting is associated with health hazards, such as air pollution, motor vehicle crashes, pedestrian injuries and fatalities, and sedentary lifestyles. Consequently the transition from automobile-focused transport to public and active transport offers environmental health benefits, including reductions in air pollution, greenhouse gases and noise pollution, and may lead to greater overall safety in transportation.

Transportation to Work,"This table contains data on the percent of residents aged 16 years and older mode of transportation to work for California, its regions, counties, cities/towns, and census tracts. Data is from the U.S. Census Bureau, Decennial Census and American Community Survey. The table is part of a series of indicators in the Healthy Communities Data and Indicators Project of the Office of Health Equity.  Commute trips to work represent 19% of travel miles in the United States. The predominant mode – the automobile - offers extraordinary personal mobility and independence, but it is also associated with health hazards, such as air pollution, motor vehicle crashes, pedestrian injuries and fatalities, and sedentary lifestyles. Automobile commuting has been linked to stress-related health problems. Active modes of transport – bicycling and walking alone and in combination with public transit – offer opportunities for physical activity, which is associated with lowering rates of heart disease and stroke, diabetes, colon and breast cancer, dementia and depression. Risk of injury and death in collisions are higher in urban areas with more concentrated vehicle and pedestrian activity.  Bus and rail passengers have a lower risk of injury in collisions than motorcyclists, pedestrians, and bicyclists. Minority communities bear a disproportionate share of pedestrian-car fatalities; Native American male pedestrians experience four times the death rate Whites or Asian pedestrians, and African-Americans and Latinos experience twice the rate as Whites or Asians.

Various explanations have been proposed for the link between poor health and unemployment; for example, economic deprivation that results in reduced access to essential goods and services.  Another explanation is that unemployment causes the loss of latent functions (social contact, social status, time structure and personal identity) which can result in stigma, isolation and loss of self-worth.

Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococci (VRE) Bloodstream Infections in Healthcare,"This dataset shows the incidence rates of hospital onset (HO) vancomycin-resistant Enterococci bloodstream infections (VRE BSI) reported by California general acute care hospitals to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN), grouped by hospital type: Critical access acute care hospital (CAH; defined as certain facilities that participate in Medicare and that are designated by states through a protocol); long-term acute care hospital (LTAC; defined by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services as providing care to patients with medically complex conditions requiring an average length of stay greater than 25 days); major teaching acute care hospital (MTAC; a hospital that self-identifies and is confirmed by California Department of Public Health (CDPH) as providing an important part of the teaching program of a medical school); pediatric acute care hospital (PED; a hospital defined by CDPH as a stand-alone children's hospital); free-standing rehabilitation acute care hospital and rehabilitation unit with its own Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services certification number (REHAB; defined by the Social Security Administration as providing care to evaluate and restore function); or community hospital (COM; a hospital not classified as one of the above other types). VRE BSI cases are classified as HO when a positive blood sample is obtained on day four or later during a hospital stay, from a patient with no prior positive blood culture within the preceding two weeks. The HO VRE BSI rate is calculated by dividing the number of cases by the total number of patient days; the rate is then reported per 10,000 patient days. The VRE BSI rates in this data release are not risk adjusted because there are no such methods available at this time. The unadjusted VRE BSI rates herein are also affected by clinical and infection control practices and/or surveillance methods. While stratifying VRE BSI rates by hospital type may make rates more comparable, it cannot control for all factors that can affect VRE BSI rates. Therefore, comparisons between hospitals within type groups (strata) should still be made with caution.

Disparities in political participation across socioeconomic groups can influence political outcomes and the resulting policies could have an impact on the opportunities available to the poor to live a healthy life.  Although there is no direct evidentiary connection between voter registration or participation and health, there is evidence that populations with higher levels of political participation also have greater social capital, the existence of trust and mutual aid among the members of a society.

Walkable Distance to Public Transit,"This table contains data on the percent of population residing within ½ mile of a major transit stop for four California regions and the counties, cities/towns, and census tracts within the regions.  The percent was calculated using data from four metropolitan planning organizations (San Diego Association of Governments, Southern California Association of Governments, Metropolitan Transportation Commission, and Sacramento Council of Governments) and the U.S. Census Bureau. The table is part of a series of indicators in the Healthy Communities Data and Indicators Project of the Office of Health Equity. A strong and sustainable transportation system supports safe, reliable, and affordable transportation opportunities for walking, bicycling, and public transit, and helps reduce health inequities by providing more opportunities for access to healthy food, jobs, health care, education, and other essential services. Active and public transportation promote health by enabling individuals to increase their level of physical activity, potentially reducing the risk of heart disease and obesity, improving mental health, and lowering blood pressure.

Preterm and Very Preterm Live Births,"This dataset contains percent preterm and very preterm live births by race/ethnic group of mother. Preterm births are all live births less than 37 weeks of gestation. Very preterm births are all live births less than 32 weeks of gestation. Important growth and development occur throughout pregnancy, especially in the final months and weeks. There is a higher risk of serious disability or death the earlier a baby is born. Gestational age is based on obstetric estimate at delivery (OE). Data includes births with gestational age of 17-47 weeks.  Note: The race and ethnic groups in this table utilize eight mutually exclusive race and ethnicity categories. These categories are Hispanic and the following Non-Hispanic categories of Multi-Race, African-American, American Indian (includes Eskimo and Aleut), Asian, Pacific Islander (includes Hawaiian), White (includes Other race) and Unknown (includes refused to state and missing).                                                                                                 

Data should not be compared to other data where gestational age is based on the date of last normal menses (LMP) and not OE. The National Center for Health Statistics recently transitioned to using an OE-based gestational age measure due to increasing evidence  of its greater validity compared with the LMP-based measure.

Newborn Screening Disorders,"This dataset contains three tables of aggregated (2009-2019) data on newborn screening disorders: 1) counts statewide , 2) counts by race/ethnicity, 3) counts by California region.  The tables present counts of disorders that have been diagnosed by the California Newborn Screening Program. Counts were suppressed for disorders with fewer than 6 cases, as described in the individual table descriptions.

The disorders are included on the core Recommended Uniform Screening Panel (RUSP) put forth by the Secretary’s Advisory Committee on Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children (SACHDNC) established under Section 1111 of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act, 42 U.S.C. 300b-10, as amended in the Newborn Screening Saves Lives Act of 2008. The SACHDNC recommends that every state newborn screening program include a uniform screening panel that currently includes 33 core disorders. The Newborn Screening Program screens for all of the core conditions except Spinal Muscular Atrophy, which began in June 2020. Newborn hearing loss screening and critical congenital heart disease screening are programs administered by the California Department of Health Care Services. Details of the disorders included on the RUSP can be found in the attachment: Recommended Uniform Screening Panel.pdf.

Caution must be taken in interpreting these data because there is not a one-to-one relationship between a screen-positive test result and a disorder. A newborn can be screen-positive for more than one disorder. Conversely, a positive screen for one disorder can be associated with the diagnosis of a different disorder. Four types of sickle cell-related hemoglobinopathies (Sickle Beta0 Thalassemia, Sickle Beta+ Thalassemia, Sickle S/S Disease, and Sickle S/C Disease) were combined into one group called ""Sickle Cell Disease.""

"Asthma Prevalence, Adults (18 and older)","This dataset contains the estimated percent of California adults (18 and older) with lifetime and current asthma (asthma prevalence), by year. The data are derived from the California Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). These data are based on self-report from telephone surveys and are subject to bias and low response rates. In 2012, the survey methodology of the BRFS changed significantly so that the survey would be more representative of the general population. Several changes were implemented: 1) the survey included both cell and landline random-digit dial components, 2) residents of college housing were eligible to complete the survey, and 3) new methods were used to calculate the survey weights. Due to these changes, estimates from 1984 – 2011 are not comparable to estimates from 2012 and beyond. CDPH and CDC recommend not conducting analyses where estimates from 1984 – 2011 are compared with analyses using the new methodology, beginning in 2012.

Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococci (VRE) Bloodstream Infections in California Hospitals,"California Health and Safety Code section 1288.55(a)(1) requires general acute care hospitals to report all cases of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) bloodstream infections (BSI) to the California Department of Public Health (CDPH). Hospitals report VRE data to CDPH via the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) following NHSN protocols and definitions.
 
CDPH downloads California hospital VRE BSI data from NHSN and analyzes the data to describe prevention progress in an annual public report of healthcare-associated infections. CDPH publishes annual VRE BSI data in datasets that include the number of VRE BSI reported by each California hospital in the specified reporting year and the hospital-onset VRE BSI rate. The VRE BSI rate is calculated by dividing the number of cases by the total number of patient days; the rate is then reported per 10,000 patient days. VRE BSI rates are not risk adjusted because there are no such methods available at this time. Aggregate mean rates used for comparisons are stratified by hospital type (and for community hospitals, by bed size).

Surgical Site Infections (SSIs) for Operative Procedures in California Hospitals,"These datasets show surgical site infections (SSIs) reported by California hospitals to the California Department of Public Health (CDPH), Healthcare-Associated Infections (HAI) Program, via the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN), in accordance with Health and Safety Code (HSC) section 1288.55. 

California hospitals track and report deep incisional and organ/space SSIs for adults and pediatric patients for 28 types of operative procedures: 
abdominal aortic aneurysm repair; abdominal hysterectomy; appendix surgery; bile duct, liver or pancreatic surgery, cardiac surgery; Cesarean section; colon surgery; coronary artery bypass graft with both chest and donor site incisions; coronary artery bypass graft with chest incision only*; exploratory abdominal surgery (laparotomy); gallbladder surgery; gastric surgery; heart transplant; hip prosthesis; kidney surgery; kidney transplant; knee prosthesis; laminectomy; liver transplant; open reduction of fracture; ovarian surgery; pacemaker surgery; rectal surgery; small bowel surgery; spinal fusion; spleen surgery; thoracic surgery; vaginal hysterectomy.
 
The SSI data tables include information on the statewide and hospital-specific SSI incidence by operative procedure types, displaying procedure counts, number of infections observed (reported) and predicted, the standardized infection ratio (SIR) and associated 95% confidence intervals, as well as statistical interpretation to show whether SSI incidence was the same (no different), better (lower), or worse (higher) than the national baseline. Another performance measure in this dataset allows for tracking hospital progress in meeting established HAI reduction goals. Hospitals must have an SIR at or below incremental targets each year to be considered on track. California hospitals should achieve 30% reductions in SSI incidence from 2015 to 2020.

NHSN calculates procedure-specific risk adjustment logistic regression models based on 2015 national baseline data and that accounts for particular patient-level factors and hospital characteristics found to be significant predictors of SSI incidence. The number of predicted infections generated from these models is used to calculate the SIR, a measure of HAI incidence, by dividing the number of actual observed infections by the number of predicted infections.

Detailed information about the variables included in each dataset are described in the accompanying data dictionaries for the year of interest.

Central Line-Associated Bloodstream infections (CLABSI) in California Hospitals,"This dataset includes central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) data reported by California hospitals to the California Department of Public Health, Healthcare-Associated Infections (HAI) Program, via the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN). Hospital types include acute care, critical access, long-term acute care, free-standing rehabilitation hospitals, as well as acute rehabilitation units that report data separately.

CLABSI data for each hospital include the number of infections observed (reported) and predicted (based on national baseline data), the number of central line-days, the Standardized Infection Ratio (SIR) and associated 95% confidence intervals, and statistical interpretation to show whether CLABSI incidence was the same (no different), better (lower), or worse (higher) than the national baseline. Another performance measure in this dataset allows for tracking hospital progress in meeting national HAI reduction goals. Hospitals must have an SIR at or below incremental targets each year to be considered on track. California hospitals should achieve 50% reductions in CLABSI from 2015 to 2020. Central line insertion practices (CLIP) adherence percent for each hospital is calculated from data reported by all critical care locations (i.e., critical care areas, neonatal critical care, and one special care area, ""Oncology - Medical/Surgical Critical Care"").

CLABSI SIRs are influenced by clinical and infection control practices related to central line insertion and infection control maintenance practices, patient-based risk factors, and surveillance and reporting methods. Health and Safety Code section 1288.55(a)(2) requires general acute care hospitals to report to the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) all cases of CLABSI identified in their facilities.

The WIC APL is a USDA mandated report it is critical to support the WIC EBT purchase. WIC EBT requires the vendor system to maintain the APL in order to match scanned food items' UPC to ensure they are on the WIC APL. The food items identified by UPC and PLU can be found in different tabs of the data file below.

The Women, Infants and Children (WIC) Program is a federally-funded health and nutrition program that provides assistance to pregnant women, new mothers, infants, and children under age five. WIC helps California families by providing food benefits to individual participants based on their nutritional need and risk assessment. The food benefits can be used to purchase healthy supplemental foods from approximately 4,000 WIC authorized vendor stores throughout the State. WIC also provides nutritional education, breastfeeding support, healthcare referrals, and other community services. Participants must meet income guidelines and other criteria. Currently, 83 WIC agencies provide services monthly to approximately one  million participants at over 650 sites in local communities throughout the State.

Each item is uniquely identified by a Universal Product Code (UPC) or Price Look-Up code (PLU) for WIC electronic benefit transfer (EBT). The WIC Authorized vendors will use the CA Authorized Product List (APL) to transact WIC food items at the cash register. The WIC APL is a USDA mandated report critical to support the WIC EBT purchase. WIC EBT requires the vendor system to maintain the APL in order to match  the scanned food items' UPC to ensure they are on the WIC APL. The food items identified by UPC and PLU can be found in different tabs of the data file below.

The Women, Infants and Children (WIC) Program is a federally-funded health and nutrition program that provides assistance to pregnant women, new mothers, infants, and children under age five. WIC helps California families by providing food benefits to individual participants based on their nutritional need and risk assessment. The food benefits can be used to purchase healthy supplemental foods from approximately 4,000 WIC authorized vendor stores throughout the State. WIC also provides nutritional education, breastfeeding support, healthcare referrals, and other community services. Participants must meet income guidelines and other criteria. Currently, 83 WIC agencies provide services monthly to approximately one  million participants at over 650 sites in local communities throughout the State.

Influenza Surveillance,"This dataset contains the following files for California influenza surveillance data: 1) Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Data by Region and Influenza Season from volunteer sentinel providers; 2) Clinical Sentinel Laboratory Influenza and Other Respiratory Virus Surveillance Data by Region and Influenza Season from volunteer sentinel laboratories; and 3) Public Health Laboratory Influenza Respiratory Virus Surveillance Data by Region and Influenza Season from California public health laboratories.
The Immunization Branch at the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) collects, compiles and analyzes information on influenza activity year-round in California and produces a weekly influenza surveillance report during October through May. The California influenza surveillance system is a collaborative effort between CDPH and its many partners at local health departments, public health and clinical laboratories, vital statistics offices, healthcare providers, clinics, emergency departments, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). California data are also included in the CDC weekly influenza surveillance report, FluView, and help contribute to the national picture of Influenza activity in the United States. The information collected allows CDPH and CDC to: 1) find out when and where influenza activity is occurring; 2) track influenza-related illness; 3) determine what influenza viruses are circulating; 4) detect changes in influenza viruses; and 5) measure the impact influenza is having on hospitalizations and deaths.

Surgical Site Infections (SSIs) for Operative Procedures in California Hospitals,"These datasets show surgical site infections (SSIs) reported by California hospitals to the California Department of Public Health (CDPH), Healthcare-Associated Infections (HAI) Program, via the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN), in accordance with Health and Safety Code (HSC) section 1288.55. 

California hospitals track and report deep incisional and organ/space SSIs for adults and pediatric patients for 28 types of operative procedures: 
abdominal aortic aneurysm repair; abdominal hysterectomy; appendix surgery; bile duct, liver or pancreatic surgery, cardiac surgery; Cesarean section; colon surgery; coronary artery bypass graft with both chest and donor site incisions; coronary artery bypass graft with chest incision only*; exploratory abdominal surgery (laparotomy); gallbladder surgery; gastric surgery; heart transplant; hip prosthesis; kidney surgery; kidney transplant; knee prosthesis; laminectomy; liver transplant; open reduction of fracture; ovarian surgery; pacemaker surgery; rectal surgery; small bowel surgery; spinal fusion; spleen surgery; thoracic surgery; vaginal hysterectomy.
 
The SSI data tables include information on the statewide and hospital-specific SSI incidence by operative procedure types, displaying procedure counts, number of infections observed (reported) and predicted, the standardized infection ratio (SIR) and associated 95% confidence intervals, as well as statistical interpretation to show whether SSI incidence was the same (no different), better (lower), or worse (higher) than the national baseline. Another performance measure in this dataset allows for tracking hospital progress in meeting established HAI reduction goals. Hospitals must have an SIR at or below incremental targets each year to be considered on track. California hospitals should achieve 30% reductions in SSI incidence from 2015 to 2020.

NHSN calculates procedure-specific risk adjustment logistic regression models based on 2015 national baseline data and that accounts for particular patient-level factors and hospital characteristics found to be significant predictors of SSI incidence. The number of predicted infections generated from these models is used to calculate the SIR, a measure of HAI incidence, by dividing the number of actual observed infections by the number of predicted infections.

Detailed information about the variables included in each dataset are described in the accompanying data dictionaries for the year of interest. 
For more information about the SIR and NHSN’s statistical models, please review the “NHSN Guide to the SIR” at https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/ps-analysis-resources/index.html

Statistics on persons served, persons per case, average grant amount, and basic demographics are presented in both tabular spreadsheets and customizable visualizations by program. In addition to presenting statistics for each program separately, the dashboard also provides data on the number of individuals participating in more than one program at the same time in a given district or county.
